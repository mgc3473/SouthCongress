We talk about it, it is an issue that has been overlooked, so I am here to change that. \nToday i will be talking about South Congress Avenue. If you live in Austin or have spent any time around here, you know the area, and you already know it’s not just another street. It has always had its own culture. Live music, local artists, taco trucks, vintage stores, families walking around, small businesses that have been there forever. It’s always been one of those places that make a city feel unique, in this case Austin. \nBut lately, it’s started to change significantly. You walk down South Congress now and you still see some of the old spots, but they’re surrounded by luxury apartments, high-end chain stores, and places clearly designed for tourists\n- I use a personal and honest tone to connect with people who know Austin, building trust while showing how South Congress has shifted from a unique, local space to something more commercial.",

          "category": "It feels like the neighborhood is shifting from being a place people live and build lives in to a place people visit and spend money.\nAnd this isn’t just about a couple of new stores or buildings being created. What’s happening on South Congress is part of a bigger issue, and that issue is gentrification. That's exactly the reason why, today, I want to break down what gentrification actually means, how it’s showing up on South Congress, and what Austin can do to address it in a fair way.\nSo let’s start with the basics. Gentrification occurs when a neighborhood begins to attract wealthier people, and as a result of that, prices increase. That might sound simple, but the impact is complicated. The people who already live there, often working-class families, people of color, and older residents, find themselves priced out. Rent goes up. Property taxes go up. Small businesses can’t afford their leases anymore. So even though the neighborhood might look “nicer” on the surface\n- I explain gentrification in a way that’s clear and easy to follow, while also using emotion and real-life examples to show why this issue matters and how it’s changing South Congress for the people who live there.",

          "category": "it’s coming at the cost of the people who built that community in the first place.\nThat’s exactly what’s happening on South Congress. It was once a working-class neighborhood with deep ties to Austin’s Black and Latino communities. It was full of local businesses, affordable rent, and longtime residents who had been there for decades. But as Austin has grown, so has the pressure to develop. The city’s booming, real estate prices are rising fast, and South Congress has become one of the most desirable areas in town. That makes it a target for investors and developers. They’re buying up property, renovating buildings, and marketing the area to people with more money.\nAnd while that might bring money into the local economy, it’s also pushing out the people who made the neighborhood what it is. That’s what gentrification does. It replaces real community with something more polished but less personal.\nThe Liberator explains this clearly.\n- I use a clear and personal tone to show how gentrification on South Congress is not just about development but about pushing out the Black, Latino, and working class communities who built the area, turning a once genuine neighborhood into something more polished but less meaningful.",

You still hear music, you still see some color, but the feeling has shifted. It has become more commercial.\nIt’s essential to note that change itself is not the enemy. Cities are always going to evolve. People move, businesses open and close, and development happens. But the question is who that change is for. Is it for the people who already live there? Or is it just for outsiders with more money? Right now, the way things are going, it’s clear that the changes on South Congress are not really being made with long-term residents in mind.\nAnd the reason this matters isn’t just because it’s unfair. It also damages the city’s identity. Austin is known for its creativity and its culture,\n-I bring in outside sources and personal observation to show that the changes on South Congress are not just physical but cultural, and I ask who these changes are really serving to make it clear that the city’s growth is coming at the cost of its identity and longtime residents.",

We lose people, stories, and connection.\nThe Guardian, one of the sources, stated “Without strong, targeted policies, the damage from gentrification is often irreversible, leaving cities more unequal and culturally sterile.” \nSo what can be done?\nIn my Project 3, I argued for two main policy approaches. First is rent control. Second is anti-displacement support for local businesses and homeowners.\nLet’s talk about rent control. It’s not some radical concept. It’s just a way to limit how much a landlord can increase rent in a year. That gives people a little more stability. It makes it harder for sudden price hikes to displace people from their homes.\n- I combine emotional appeal with evidence and a clear call to action by showing how gentrification erases not just places but people and culture, then shift into a solutions-based approach using my own research and credible sources to argue for fairer housing policies like rent control.",

However, that’s not necessarily true if the policy is well-designed and effectively enforced. As Dorazio at the Center for American Progress explains, “Localized rent control efforts can help reduce displacement without halting all new development.” So it’s not either-or. We can have growth and still protect residents.\nRent control helps people stay. That’s what matters.\nBut even rent control won’t solve everything. That’s why we also need anti-displacement policies. That means creating programs that support local business owners, especially those who’ve been serving the community for years. It also means protecting homeowners from rising property taxes, offering grants to renters, and ensuring tenants are aware of their rights.\nTo put this into perspective,\n- I respond to common counterarguments with evidence and logic, showing that rent control can work alongside development, and I expand the solution by pushing for anti-displacement policies that focus on protecting the people and businesses who make the community feel like home.",

They didn’t stop development. They just made it more balanced. This could be established in Austin. \nThere are also other ideas we should explore, such as inclusionary zoning, which would require developers to incorporate affordable housing into new construction, or community land trusts, which can keep housing permanently affordable by removing the land from the market. These solutions already exist. We don’t have to invent anything new. We just have to care enough to use them.\nBeyond policy, though, this is about values. Do we want to be a city that protects its people, or one that only accommodates wealth? Do we want to preserve what makes Austin what it is?\nAnd no, this isn’t about being anti-business or anti-growth. \n- I use real examples and practical solutions to show that cities like Portland have already taken steps to balance growth with fairness, and I shift the focus from just policy to values by asking what kind of city we want Austin to be",

If the neighborhood still reflects the diversity it always had. If people who grew up near South Congress can afford to stay. That means success. \nBooe and Lippman say it well: “Preserving the character of South Congress means making room for both growth and tradition.” That’s the balance we should be aiming for.\nUltimately, this is about the city's future. South Congress is just one example, but it shows us where things are heading. If we want Austin to stay creative, diverse, and real, we have to act like it. That means policy, support, and intentional choices.\nThank you so much for listening. I hope this gave you something to think about.\n- in this last part I put everything back to values and community, using a hopeful but urgent tone to show that real success means keeping South Congress diverse and livable, and I end by encouraging action through clear, simple goals and a reminder that the future of Austin depends on the choices we make now.",
